**First test**: can we generate a basic evaluation based on Inspect evals with some config? 

Run ```setup.py``` after reviewing the config and prompts. 

See ```sample_output_gen.py``` for the first pass code generated by GPT4o with the prompt provided. 

Issues with generation: 

* The hugging face call is wrong - it should be hf_dataset as below

```from inspect_ai.dataset import hf_dataset```

* Scorer and import are also incorrect
